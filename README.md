# Computer-Vision-Assignments
This repository contains all my  assignments work, completed during CSE 6367 course under Prof. Marnim Galib at UTA. Total 4 assignments covers topics from Hough transform, different edge detection implementations, blurring, generating eigenfaces using k-eigenvectors, and Creating Panorama image.

List of all the Programming assignments is as below:

1. PA1:<br />
   1.1 Color channels tasks, Geometric transformations such as rotaion, translation, scaling of image<br />
   1.2 Blurring: Average blurring/Gaussian blur for different kernel sizes<br />
   1.3 Edge detection and Gradient calculation: Sobel/Prewitt/Laplacian/DoG edge detectors

2. PA2:<br />
   2.1 Line detection using Hough transform & Canny edge detector<br />
   2.2 Circle detection using Hough transform method

3. PA3: Eigenfaces/PCA reconstruction/Finding nearest train image for test images<br />
   3.1 Mean face & Eigenfaces: Importing 'train' face images(25 images), finding their mean face and displaying and calculating eigenfaces<br />
   3.2 Reconstruction of faces using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) - I've implemented PCA manually using covaraince matrix and sorting eigenvalues in descending order (Works exactly similar to the benchmark method PCA from Scikit-learn<br />
   3.3 PCA on Test images<br />
   3.4 Finding most similar train image for each test image (for k=2,5,15): Most interesting part of the assignment is to find out nearest train image for all the test images.

4. PA4: Creating Panorama image using 3 images of a building.<br />
   4.1: Used SIFT for image descriptors and matching them using K-NN<br />
   4.2 After stitching image 1 with 2 and image 2 with 3. Finally stitching image_12 and image_23 to create final Panorama image: image_123.
